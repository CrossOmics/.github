CrossOmics aims to build bioinformatics analysis tools. It is still under development; we are continuing to develop new algorithms for different omics and are working to implement them efficiently. We are motivated by deep curiosity in mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and biology. The main purpose of this research is for fun.
